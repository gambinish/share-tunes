# Share Tunes

Create a collaborative playlist with your Spotify account and show off your great taste in music. This project was built during the June 2019 Angelhack Virtual Hackathon.

_Please Note: You will need a Spotify Premium account to play music directly in the application. Otherwise, this app can work as a controller on the official Spotify web, desktop, or mobile app._
